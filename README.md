# Julie.help! - Backend

Hey there!

Welcome to Julie.help!

This project was built focusing on getting better at a few languages, best practices and building a portfolio.
I'm glad to be here, if you have suggestions please let me know.

Julie.help! is a small system that uses a MySQL database and RESTful endpoints.

The project is a coworking management system which brings a modern interface using the best development technologies.

I hope you enjoy the experience!
